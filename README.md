# C Logging Library

## Overview

Welcome to the C Logging Library repository! This library is designed to provide a simple and efficient logging solution for C applications. While the current version is tailored for Linux environments, we have exciting plans to expand its features and support multiple platforms in the future.

## Features

### Formating
Formating the LogMessages can be customised with the following tags<br>
to format all following Log Messages use: set_Formating(char* format);<br>
e.g. set_Formating("$B[$T] $L [$F]  $C$E")  or set_Formating("$BTime:[$M $S] $L $E ==> $C")
    
$T		Time		hh:mm:ss<br>
$H		Time Hour	hh<br>
$M		Time Min.	mm<br>
$S		Time Sec.	ss<br>

$N		Date		yyyy:mm:dd<br>
$Y		Date Year	yyyy<br>
$O		Date Month	mm<br>
$D		Date Day	dd<br>

$L		LogLevel	[TRACE], [DEBUG] . . . [FATAL]<br>
$F		Func. Name	main, foo<br>
$A		File Name	main.c foo.c<br>
$B		Color Begin	from here the color starts<br>
$E		Color End	from here the color ends<br>
$C		Text		Formated Message with variables<br>

### Implemented Features

1. **Log Levels:**
   - TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and FATAL levels are supported to give you fine-grained control over the verbosity of your logs.

2. **Log Formatting:**
   - Customize log message formats, including timestamp, log level, and other relevant information, to enhance readability and analysis.

3. **Conditional Logging:**
   - Choose to enable or disable logging for specific log levels or modules based on your needs.

4. **Configurability:**
   - Enable dynamic configuration adjustments to logging settings, allowing developers to adapt the library to different environments easily.

5. **Buffering:**
   - Optimize logging performance with buffering mechanisms to reduce the overhead of frequent disk or network writes.

### Planned Features

1. **Multithreading:**
   - Introduce thread safety mechanisms to ensure the library works seamlessly in multithreaded environments.

2. **Platform Support:**
   - Expand the library to support multiple platforms, making it versatile for various deployment scenarios.

3. **Log Rotation:**
   - Implement log rotation to prevent log files from growing too large, with configurable options for size limits, retention, and rotation intervals.

4. **Thread Safety:**
   - Enhance the library's thread safety to prevent race conditions and ensure reliable logging in concurrent applications.

5. **Integration with System Logging:**
   - Provide integration with the system logging facility on different platforms, enhancing interoperability.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle situations like log file write failures and provide informative error messages.

7. **Asynchronous Logging:**
   - Introduce asynchronous logging capabilities to minimize performance impact and improve the responsiveness of your application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the C Logging Library, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository as a submodule
2. Include the library header in your source code: `#include "logging.h"`
3. Start logging using the provided functions.

For more detailed instructions and examples, refer to the documentation.
